# TODO

Eliminate `force` by extending Brevity `Data`. If a variant is constructed with a function, that function becomes the getter for the associated field

`memoFix` should be lifted to the `Brevity` library
    - note the @final-hill dependency on Multi-key-map
    - can there be a Brevity style implementation of Multi-key-map?
